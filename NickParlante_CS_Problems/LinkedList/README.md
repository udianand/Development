Linked List Problems from Stanford CS Education Library by Nick Parlante, http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdf

Abstract:

This document reviews basic linked list code techniques and then works through 18
linked list problems covering a wide range of difficulty. Most obviously, these problems
are a way to learn about linked lists. More importantly, these problems are a way to
develop your ability with complex pointer algorithms. Even though modern languages
and tools have made linked lists pretty unimportant for day-to-day programming, the
skills for complex pointer algorithms are very important, and linked lists are an excellent
way to develop those skills.

The problems use the C language syntax, so they require a basic understanding of C and
its pointer syntax. The emphasis is on the important concepts of pointer manipulation and
linked list algorithms rather than the features of the C language.
