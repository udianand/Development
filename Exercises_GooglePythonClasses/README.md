Exercises-from-Google-s-Python-Class
====================================

The repository contains solution to the exercises given in Google's Python Class, https://developers.google.com/edu/python/.

According to the link, this class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding. These materials are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just a little programming experience. The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections. The class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming experience in some language, enough to know what a "variable" or "if statement" is. Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to use this material.

There are 3 types of exercises:

1. Basic Exercises
2. Baby Names Exercise
3. Copy Special Exercise


The repository is divided 3 directories based on the types of the exercises described above.

Note: There are solutions already posted for these examples on the URL of the Python class. However, it still makes for good practice if you do not refer to the solutions. In addition, it is a good way pass time ;)
